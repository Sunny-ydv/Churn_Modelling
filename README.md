# Churn_Modelling
Predict customer churn using a Random Forest Classifier on bank data. Includes data cleaning, one-hot encoding, model training, accuracy check, feature importance, and visualization. Built during my data science internship to understand churn behavior and ML pipelines.


# Churn_Modelling

This is a simple machine learning project to predict bank customer churn using a Random Forest Classifier. It was done as part of my data science internship.

## Dataset
The dataset `Churn_Modelling.csv` contains customer info like CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Balance, and whether they exited (churned).

## What it does
- Loads and cleans the data
- One-hot encodes categorical columns
- Splits data into training and test sets
- Trains a Random Forest model
- Shows model accuracy and feature importance
- Plots top features

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Make sure Python and these libraries are installed:
   - pandas
   - scikit-learn
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
3. Place `Churn_Modelling.csv` in the same folder.
4. Run:



or open and run the Jupyter Notebook.

## Output
- Accuracy ~86%
- Feature importance bar chart
- Classification report
